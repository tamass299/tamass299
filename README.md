- 👋 Hi, I’m @tamass299
- 👀 I’m interested in environmental topics, ecology, societal problems (some of which are directly connected to the ecological crysis), stats, cycling & music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of databases (SQL), and trying to develop on the field of IT
- 💞️ I’m looking to get more knowledge about this segment of IT which has truly become a must for natural scientists. Basically I'm here to learn first.
